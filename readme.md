# My node Js Complete project 
*All Goals achieved:*
* SignUp and Login using Passport mongoose
* Login password saved with salting and Hashing method
* to-do list works fine, with all the routes and data going through Database
* Updates directly into Mongo Db 

## Notes:
* If you want pre loaded data stored into database uncomment line 114 (async databasecalls()..) and run node app.js once
* Unfortunelty you have to create two users, user1 and user2 with same password

Everything works as mentioned along with saving session using dotenv and other functionaltity works fine
